# Machine Learning
The collection of assignments I completed in my CENG499 Machine Learning course. All answers are in Python.


The `hwX.pdf` files contain the homework description, the `data_and_source_codes.tar.gz` directory contains the given dataset and source codes that are initially empty and I have to fill in.

The `my_submission` folder contains the files I completed and submitted from the source codes, including my detailed reports on the implementations and findings.
